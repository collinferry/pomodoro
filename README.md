# Pomodoro Timer

<img src="http://collinferry.com/codepen/pomo.jpg">

There obviously weren't enough Pomodoro timers on the internet so I created one myself. </br>
1) Adjust the work and break times using the +/- buttons </br>
2) Click the "Work" or "Play" button so begin the timer. </br>
3) Plays a tone when the time is up. </br>

Complete with a basic animation which actually is just experimental aesthetic (which is to say it does not interact with anything else in a meaningful way).
